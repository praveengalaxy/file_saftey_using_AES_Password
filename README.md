## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file_safety_using_AES_Password.git
   cd file_safety_using_AES_Password
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## üéØ Usage

### Encryption Process

1. **Navigate to the application**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Click "Get Started" or navigate to the encryption page

2. **Select files**
   - Choose single or multiple files to encrypt
   - Supported formats: Any file type (documents, images, videos, etc.)

3. **Set password**
   - Enter a strong password (minimum 8 characters recommended)
   - This password will be used to derive the encryption key

4. **Encrypt files**
   - Click "Encrypt Files" button
   - The application will process your files and provide download links
   - Encrypted files are saved with `.enc` extension

### Decryption Process

1. **Upload encrypted files**
   - Select the `.enc` files you want to decrypt
   - You can process multiple files simultaneously

2. **Enter password**
   - Use the same password that was used for encryption
   - The system will verify the password and decrypt the files

3. **Download decrypted files**
   - Decrypted files will be available for download
   - Original filenames are preserved (without `.enc` extension)

### Security Best Practices

- **Use strong passwords**: Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Keep passwords secure**: Store passwords in a password manager
- **Backup encrypted files**: Keep multiple copies of important encrypted files
- **Regular updates**: Keep the application and dependencies updated

## üîê Security Details

### Cryptographic Implementation

The application uses industry-standard cryptographic practices:

```python
# Key Derivation (PBKDF2)
kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
    algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
    length=32,                    # 256-bit key
    salt=salt,                    # Random 16-byte salt
    iterations=100_000,           # High iteration count
    backend=default_backend()
)

# Encryption (Fernet/AES-256)
fernet = Fernet(key)
encrypted = fernet.encrypt(data)
```

### Security Features

- **AES-256**: Military-grade encryption algorithm
- **PBKDF2**: Password-based key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- **Random Salt**: 16-byte random salt per file prevents rainbow table attacks
- **Authenticated Encryption**: Fernet provides both confidentiality and integrity
- **Secure File Handling**: Files are processed securely without leaving traces

### File Format

Encrypted files follow this structure:
```
[16-byte salt][encrypted data]
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can customize the application behavior by setting environment variables:

```bash
# Flask configuration
export FLASK_ENV=production
export FLASK_DEBUG=False

# Application settings
export UPLOAD_FOLDER=./secure_files
export MAX_FILE_SIZE=100MB
```

### Application Settings

Key configuration options in `app.py`:

```python
# Secret key for session management
app.secret_key = 'your-secret-key-here'

# Upload folder for processed files
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'files_example'

# PBKDF2 iterations (higher = more secure but slower)
iterations = 100_000
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "No file selected" error**
- Ensure you've selected at least one file before submitting
- Check that the file size is within acceptable limits

**2. "Decryption failed" error**
- Verify you're using the correct password
- Ensure the file wasn't corrupted during transfer
- Check that the file has the `.enc` extension

**3. "Module not found" error**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify you're using the correct Python environment

**4. Port already in use**
- Change the port in `app.py`: `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`
- Or kill the process using the current port

### Performance Optimization

- **Large files**: The application handles large files efficiently through streaming
- **Multiple files**: Batch processing is optimized for multiple files
- **Memory usage**: Files are processed in chunks to minimize memory consumption
